# Banking-System
A Java program that simulates a simple banking system. The program allows users to register, authenticate, create bank accounts, deposit funds, withdraw funds, and view transaction history.

**Description**

The Simple Banking System program consists of the following classes:

User: Represents a user with a username and password. Users can be registered and authenticated.

BankAccount: Represents a bank account with an account number, balance, and transaction history. Bank accounts can be created, and funds can be deposited or withdrawn. The transaction history can be printed.

BankingSystem: Implements the banking system functionality. It manages the users and bank accounts, handles user registration, authentication, and account operations.

_The program flow is as follows:_

Users can register with a username and password.

Users can authenticate with their credentials.

Authenticated users can create bank accounts with an account number.

Users can deposit funds into their bank accounts.

Users can withdraw funds from their bank accounts if the balance is sufficient.

Users can view the transaction history for their bank accounts.

**Features**

User registration and authentication.
Bank account creation.
Deposit funds into a bank account.
Withdraw funds from a bank account.
View transaction history for a bank account.


**Usage**

Compile the Java program:

The program will register a user with the username "john123" and password "password123".

The program will authenticate the user with the provided credentials.

If the authentication is successful, the program will create a bank account with the account number "ACC123".

The program will deposit $1000 into the bank account and withdraw $500 from the account.

The program will display the account balance and print the transaction history for the account.

**Acknowledgments**

The Simple Banking System project serves as a basic implementation of banking operations using Java. It demonstrates the fundamentals of object-oriented programming, user authentication, and account management. The program can be extended to include additional features such as balance inquiries, fund transfers, and user interfaces for a more comprehensive banking system.
